<h1> 3-Bit-Synchronous-Up-Down-Counter-using-Icarus-Verilog<h1><br/>
  <br/>
Implements 3 Bit Synchronous up counter and 3 bit Down counter using Icarus Verilog.<br/>
<br/>
In synchronous counter clock is provided to all the flip-flops simultaneously.
Here the mode control input is used to decide whether which sequence will be generated by the counter.
In this case, mode control input is used to decide whether the counter will perform up counting or down counting.
Designing of such a counter is the same as designing a synchronous counter but the extra combinational logic for mode control input is required.<br/>
  <br/>

The file names with "_tb" as suffix are the testbench files.
Other files are the implementation files ( the logic of the code ).<br/>
  <br/>


The commands to simulate 3 Bit Up counter:<br/>
1. iverilog -o up Up.v Up_tb.v<br/>
2. vvp up<br/>
Followed by waveform observation with the command:<br/>
1. gtkwave up.vcd<br/>
<br/>
The commands to simulate 3 Bit Down counter:<br/>
1. iverilog -o down Down.v Down_tb.v<br/>
2. vvp down<br/>
Followed by waveform observation with the command:<br/>
1. gtkwave down.vcd<br/>
